The scarcity of manufacturers and the related high retail prices, however, are restricting access to the instrument for new generations of musicians. By combining modern technologies and scientific research, the Bandoneon 2.0 project aims to create an expressive and accessible new version of the instrument. In this article we present an electronic bandoneon with a custom sound synthesis system. We also present an acoustic measurement system with which we analyzed the sound and air pressure signals of an acoustic bandoneon. Through this, we characterized several sound attributes that are utilized in a synthesis model made in Faust DSP. Combining the controller interface and the custom synthesizer, the electronic bandoneon we created can achieve a good level of expressiveness and engagement for the performer. We aim to produce an instrument that can be used in recreational, academic, and professional contexts to address the current sociocultural demand.}",

title={A simple and cheap setup for timing tapping responses synchronized to auditory stimuli},
journal={Behavior Research Methods},

month={Aug},
day={03},
abstract={Measuring human capabilities to synchronize in time, adapt to perturbations to timing sequences, or reproduce time intervals often requires experimental setups that allow recording response times with millisecond precision. Most setups present auditory stimuli using either MIDI devices or specialized hardware such as Arduino and are often expensive or require calibration and advanced programming skills. Here, we present in detail an experimental setup that only requires an external sound card and minor electronic skills, works on a conventional PC, is cheaper than alternatives, and requires almost no programming skills. It is intended for presenting any auditory stimuli and recording tapping response times with within 2-ms precision (up to - 2 ms lag). This paper shows why desired accuracy in recording response times against auditory stimuli is difficult to achieve in conventional computer setups, presents an experimental setup to overcome this, and explains in detail how to set it up and use the provided code. Finally, the code for analyzing the recorded tapping responses was evaluated, showing that no spurious or missing events were found in 94{\%} of the analyzed recordings.},

It discusses the fundamental architectural features that make the original library unique compared to other Python clients which differ in approach or scope. An exploration of how general purpose programming languages techniques and paradigms are used to represent DSP algorithms and musical structures is made while exposing the different components of the library, technical decisions and a few needed adaptations to the resources of the target language. It also presents the implementation of a non real time mode to create OSC scores from the same code used in real time. Finally, the advantages and disadvantages of the library itself are discussed.},
